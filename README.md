##Description: Personal Portfolio Website

The Personal Portfolio Website is a single-page responsive website developed using HTML and CSS. It is designed to showcase a developer's personal information, skills, projects, and contact details in a clean and structured manner. This project was created using the SPCK Editor, a mobile code editor that allows developers to write and preview code on the go. The purpose of this website is to create a professional digital presence and provide an online platform where visitors can learn more about the developer’s background and view their work.

The structure of the website consists of several key sections: the header, about, projects, contact, and footer. At the top of the page, the header includes the portfolio title and a navigation bar. The navigation bar contains internal links that allow smooth scrolling to different sections of the page, which improves usability and user experience, especially on mobile devices.

The "About Me" section introduces the developer, J. Sandhya, who is a second-year Information Technology student. It includes a brief description of interests and technical skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. It also highlights a passion for web development and a goal of becoming a full-stack developer. This section provides insight into the developer’s learning journey, mindset, and future aspirations.

The "Projects" section showcases a sample project built by the developer. The featured project is a simple real-time chat application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chat app uses the localStorage API to allow communication between multiple tabs within the same browser. The project includes an input field, a message display area, and a send button. While it is a basic prototype, it demonstrates key development skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and using browser APIs for storing and syncing data. This section gives visitors an idea of the developer’s practical skills and ability to create functional web applications.

The "Contact" section provides essential contact details like email and a GitHub profile. This allows potential employers, collaborators, or visitors to reach out or explore the developer’s code repositories and other work. It’s an important part of building a professional network and encouraging communication.

Finally, the footer contains a copyright notice with the developer’s name and the current year, offering a neat and professional end to the page.

The design of the website is minimalistic and user-friendly. CSS is used to apply consistent styling across all sections, ensuring readability and a pleasant visual layout. The site is also responsive, meaning it adapts well to different screen sizes, including phones and tablets.

In conclusion, this portfolio website effectively demonstrates the developer’s technical ability, creativity, and understanding of frontend development principles. It is a foundational step in building an online presence and can be expanded in the future with more features such as a blog, downloadable resume, or project gallery. This project shows that even with basic tools, one can create a polished and functonal website.
