      <h3>Project 1</h3>
      <p>This project is a simple real-time chat app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the SPCK Editor. It enables communication between multiple tabs in the same browser using the localStorage API. Messages are stored with timestamps and synced across tabs through the storage event. The interface includes an input field, send button, and message display area. This setup works only within the same browser and device. It doesn't support communication across different browsers or devices. The app requires no server, making it ideal for local real-time chat prototypes.</p>
